# Garbage management in Indore
Indore has consistently performed well in the Swachh Survekshan survey since 2017 due to its integrated approach to solid waste management and efficient waste processing. The city, with a population of nearly 2 million, generates about 1,900 tonnes of solid waste per day. Indore has become a global model for solid waste management. It has established defined systems and processes and reaps benefits year on year. The city has been divided into 85 Wards and 19 Zones as the operational area for Solid Waste Management (SWM). In Indore, waste is collected in a segregated manner i.e. the waste is segregated at the source by the generators.
